# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer

1. No dependency array:

   The callback function passed into `useEffect()` will be called every time that `MyComponent` is re-rendered

2. Empty dependency array - `[]`:

   The callback function passed into `useEffect()` is called on the initial render of `MyComponent`

3. Non-empty array - `[someProp, someState, ...]`:

   The callback function passed into `useEffect()` is called on the change of the elements of the array (`someProp`, `someState`)
