# Question

What are the two arguments that `useEffect` accepts?

# Answer

The first argument of `useEffect` is a callback function that the function will execute. The second argument is the dependency argument. It is optional. If nothing is passed, the callback function will be called on every render of the component it is apart of. If an empty array is passed, then the callback function will be invoked for only one render. If the array has any elements, the callback function will run an initial time, then run any time one of those elements change.
